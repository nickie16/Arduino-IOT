=============================== MANUAL DOCUMENT - ARDUINO METEO STATION =============================================

Basic Description
  The purpose of this station is to capture the values of various physical quantities, store them, analyze them 
  and finally present them to the user, in order to depict a general overview of the weather.
  
Main Concept
  Meteo Station gathers information about temperature, humidity, brightness and presence of rain. Each time we 
  collect a measurement from all the above sensors and we store them -CSV format- in the SD card. 
  
Display  
  The Station features a screen where current values are being displayed. By pressing menu buttons the user 
  is able to iterate through the values of the different quantities.
  
Energy policy
  Station wakes up periodically once every minute to collect the measurments and then goes again in sleep mode.
  In order to display current values in the screen an interruput is used to wake up the arduino. After one minute
  of inactivity arduino goes back to sleep and the screen gets turned off. Power sourse is currently batteries.

Boxing and Installation
  Still pending ....

========================================= FUTURE IMPROVMENTS =======================================================

- More sensors like: Soil Humidity sensor, BMP185 Barometer 
- Eliminate arduino board to only the basic components needed in order to save energy and space
- Powered by solar panel and charging a battery (with or without an alternate power sourse) 
- WebApp for displaying results (Station should work as a server presenting the results nicely in a graphic manner.
    Probably arduino along with a wifi is not enough, raspberry pi is needed)
